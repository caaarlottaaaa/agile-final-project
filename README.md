# Agile Final Project – Product Catalog Back-End

This repository contains the final project for the Coursera Agile course.

## Project Overview
The goal is to simulate the development of a back-end product catalog using Agile practices. The project includes 10 user stories covering core functionality such as:

- Product creation, listing, and filtering  
- Product interaction (like/dislike)  
- Deployment and cloud hosting automation  

## Issue Tracking
All user stories have been created using a custom issue template and labeled as enhancements. They are assigned to the “Final Project” board and organized in the Product Backlog.

## Agile Artifacts
- ✅ User Stories with Gherkin-formatted Acceptance Criteria  
- ✅ GitHub Project board with To Do, In Progress, and Done columns  
- ✅ Labels applied for issue categorization  
- ✅ Project assigned to each issue
